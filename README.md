## ‚ô® Preparation
(1) Please download the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17orep2zqE7LrsqTsKI6l4AKMC3jiD_yc/view?usp=sharing) and put it into the root path of the project `./UGDA/`;    
(2) Please run the commend:  `pip install -r requirments.txt`;

## ‚ô® Script Running
please use the following commend to run the scripts:  
`bash runcmd/{data name}/run.sh`

The results will be around to the followings:

üìå To improve readability, we have comprehensively polished the code 
before releasing it, including comprehensive cleaning and re-organization, 
which may result in slight differences from the original one. Please be free to leave 
your questions in the issue panel. The paper is available at here: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10123043/](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10123043/). If our work is helpful for your research,
